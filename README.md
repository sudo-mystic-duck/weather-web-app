## Use of AI
I used AI to write the code but I said exactly what it had to do, went over the code and looked if it's ok. You can see that from the few comments I let there. Yeah I really don't know if I should AI to write the code or not. I can't decide. Should I use it to write code faster and "help" the RAM shortage and ruin someones live or don't use it but then it would take longer. But the AI often gets things wrong and then I have to fix them. I really don't know. If there is someone out there reading this, please email me and tell me your opinion!
